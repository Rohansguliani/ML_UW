The number of goals scored in six games is now given as \( [2, 4, 6, 0, 1, 8] \). To find the updated numerical estimate of \( \lambda \), we use the maximum likelihood estimate:
\[
\hat{\lambda} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n x_i.
\]

Substituting the values:
\[
\hat{\lambda} = \frac{2 + 4 + 6 + 0 + 1 + 8}{6} = \frac{21}{6} = 3.5.
\]

Thus, the updated \( \lambda \) is:
\[
\hat{\lambda} = 3.5.
\]

Next, we calculate the probability that the team scores 6 goals in their 7th game. The number of goals per game follows a Poisson distribution, with probability mass function:
\[
P(X = x \mid \lambda) = \frac{\lambda^x e^{-\lambda}}{x!}.
\]

Substituting \( x = 6 \) and \( \lambda = 3.5 \):
\[
P(X = 6 \mid \lambda = 3.5) = \frac{3.5^6 e^{-3.5}}{6!}.
\]

We compute this step by step:
1. Compute \( 3.5^6 \):
\[
3.5^6 = 1838.265625.
\]

2. Compute \( e^{-3.5} \):
\[
e^{-3.5} \approx 0.030197.
\]

3. Compute \( 6! \):
\[
6! = 720.
\]

Substitute these values:
\[
P(X = 6 \mid \lambda = 3.5) = \frac{1838.265625 \cdot 0.030197}{720}.
\]

Simplify:
\[
P(X = 6 \mid \lambda = 3.5) \approx \frac{55.459}{720} \approx 0.0771.
\]

Thus, the probability that the team scores 6 goals in their 7th game is approximately:
\[
P(X = 6 \mid \lambda = 3.5) \approx 0.0771 \quad \text{(7.71\%)}.
\]
