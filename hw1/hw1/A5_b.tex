The training and testing errors of the Ridge Regression classifier trained on the MNIST dataset with \(\lambda = 10^{-4}\) are as follows:

\[
\text{Train Error: } 14.805\%
\]
\[
\text{Test Error: } 14.66\%
\]

These errors demonstrate the performance of the classifier on both the training and testing datasets.
